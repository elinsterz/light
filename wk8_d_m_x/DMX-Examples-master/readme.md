# DMX Examples

A collection of examples for controlling DMX512 lights and other devices, in a variety of programming environments.

This repository combines many of the examples I've written for node.js and Arduino to control DMX devices. It also includes two older repositories that I deleted, nodeDmx and DmxSimpleExamples.
