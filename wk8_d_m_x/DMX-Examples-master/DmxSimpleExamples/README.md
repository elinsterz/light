# DmxSimple Examples

A collection of examples using the [DMXSimple library](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/td_libs_DmxSimple.html) for Arduino. These were all made using a 32-U4-based Arduino model like the Leonardo or Micro, in order to take advantage of the extra interrupt pins. Many of them may work on an Uno as well, though those using the Encoder library may not work as smoothly.  As of this writing, the DMXSimple library does not work on the M0-based boards.

These were all tested using the Arduino DMX Shield, on pin 3. The [Plankman SuperDMX shield](http://learn.plankman.com/superDmxShield/) will also work with these, on pin 12.
